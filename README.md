SwiftComp-flutter is a mobile app designed to provide a comprehensive composite calculator based on the SwiftComp software, a general-purpose multiscale constitutive modeling code for composites. The app is available on both the App Store and Google Play Store, making it accessible to a wide range of users. A web version is also available at [CompositesAI.com](https://compositesai.com/).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Lamina Stress/Strain:** Compute stress and strain for a single layer with arbitrary fiber orientation.
- **Lamina Engineering Constants:** Compute engineering constants for a lamina with arbitrary fiber orientation.
- **Laminar Stress/Strain:** Compute stress and strain distribution within a lamiante.
- **Laminate Plate Properties:** Compute the ABD matrices for a laminate.
- **Laminate 3D Properties:** Compute 3D properties for a laminate.
- **UDFRC Properties:** Compute 3D properties for unidirectional fiber-reinforced composites (UDFRC).
- **Chat:** A built-in AI Campanion for asking questions and performing calculations.

## üìã Requirements

- Dart: >=3.3.0 <4.0.0
- Flutter: >=3.19.0

## üì≤ Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Flutter installed on your system. You can follow the official Flutter [installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) if you haven‚Äôt done so already.
Please install Flutter `3.19.0`

cd swiftcomp-flutter
```

2. **Install Dependencies** Install the necessary Flutter dependencies by running:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables** Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. For example:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
AMPLIFY_CONFIG=your_amplify_config_json
```

4. **Run the Application** 
```bash
flutter run
```
Then choose your device, it could be iOS, Android, or web.
