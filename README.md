SwiftComp-flutter is a mobile application designed to provide a comprehensive composite calculator based on the SwiftComp software, an efficient multiscale modeling tool for composites. The app is available on both the App Store and Google Play Store, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

## Features

- **Lamina Stress/Strain:** Calculate stress and strain for lamina layers.
- **Lamina Engineering Constants:** Determine the engineering constants for individual lamina.
- **Laminar Stress/Strain:** Analyze stress and strain across multiple lamina layers.
- **Laminate Plate Properties:** Compute the properties of laminate plates.
- **Laminate 3D Properties:** Evaluate the three-dimensional properties of laminate materials.
- **UDFRC Properties:** Calculate the properties for user-defined fiber-reinforced composites (UDFRC).
- **Chat (Coming Soon):** A built-in AI expert chat feature is currently under development.
